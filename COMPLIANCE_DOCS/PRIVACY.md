# Privacy Policy for Zu Shield

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Zu Shield ("we", "our", or "the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### 2.1 Email Content (Transient Processing)
- **What we access:** The extension accesses the text of emails displayed in your browser tabs (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) for the sole purpose of analyzing toxicity.
- **How it is used:** This data is processed locally in your browser's memory. If you enable AI features (Translation/Reply Guard), specific text snippets are sent to the OpenRouter API for processing.
- **Storage:** **We do NOT store your email content.** Text sent to the AI API is transient and is not retained by us.

### 2.2 API Keys and Settings
- **Storage:** Your OpenRouter API key and extension settings are stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
- **Access:** These keys are never transmitted to us or any third party other than the OpenRouter service itself for authentication.

### 2.3 Aggregated Statistics
- **What we look at:** We store local counters for "Emails Shielded" and "Translations" to display your daily impact stats.
- **Privacy:** These statistics are strictly local to your device and are never reported back to any server.

## 3. Third-Party Services
We use **OpenRouter.ai** as our AI provider. When you use the "Translate" or "Calm Reply" features, text is sent to OpenRouter.

## 4. Data Security
- All communication between the extension and the OpenRouter API occurs directly from your browser via HTTPS.
- We do not operate any intermediary servers.
